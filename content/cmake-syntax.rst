CMake syntax
============


.. questions::

   - How can we achieve more control over the build system generated by CMake?
   - Is it possible to let the user decide what to generate?


.. objectives::

   - Learn how to define variables with ``set`` and use them with the ``${}``
     operator for `variable references <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references>`_.
   - Learn the syntax for conditionals in CMake: |if| - ``elseif`` - ``else`` - ``endif``
   - Learn the syntax for loops in CMake: |foreach|
   - Learn how CMake structures build artifacts.
   - Learn how to print helpful messages.
   - Learn how to handle user-facing options: |option| and the role of CMake cache.


CMake offers a *domain-specific language* (DSL) to describe how to generate a build system native to the specific platform you might be running on. In this episode, we will get acquainted with its syntax.
