CMake syntax
============


.. questions::

   - How can we achieve more control over the build system generated by CMake?
   - Is it possible to let the user decide what to generate?


.. objectives::

   - Learn how to define variables with ``set`` and use them with the ``${}``
     operator for `variable references <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references>`_.
   - Learn the syntax for conditionals in CMake: ``if`` - ``elseif`` - ``else`` - ``endif``
   - Learn the syntax for loops in CMake: ``foreach``
   - Learn how CMake structures build artifacts.
   - Learn how to print helpful messages.
   - Learn how to handle user-facing options: ``option`` and the role of CMake cache.


CMake offers a **domain-specific language** (DSL) to describe how to generate a build system native to the specific platform you might be running on. In this episode, we will get acquainted with its syntax.


The CMake DSL
-------------


Remember that the DSL is **case-insensitive**. We will now have a look at its main elements.


Variables
+++++++++


These are either CMake- or user-defined variables. You can obtain the list of CMake-defined variables with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-variable-list

You can create a new variable with the ``set`` command:

.. signature:: ``set``

   .. code-block:: cmake

      set(<variable> <value>... [PARENT_SCOPE])


Variables in CMake are always of string type, but certain commands can interpret them as other types. If you want to declare a *list* variable, you will have to provide it as a ;-separated string. Lists can be manipulated with the ``list`` family of commands.

You can inspect the value of any variable by *dereferencing* it with the ``${}`` operator, as in bash shell. For example, the following snippet sets the content of ``hello`` variable and then prints it:

.. code-block:: cmake

   set(hello "world")
   message("hello ${hello}")


Two notes about **variable references**:

- if the variable within the ``${}`` operator is not set, you will get an empty string.
- you can *nest* variable references: ``${outer_${inner_variable}_variable}``. They will be evaluated from the inside out.


One of the most confusing aspects in CMake is the **scoping of variables**. There are three variable scopes in the DSL:

- **Function**: In effect when a variable is ``set`` within a function, the variable
  will be visible within the function, but not outside.
- **Directory**: In effect when processing a ``CMakeLists.txt`` in a directory, variables in the parent folder will be available, but any that is ``set`` in the current folder will not be propagated to the parent.
- **Cache**: These variables are **persistent** across calls to ``cmake`` and available to all scopes in the project. Modifying a cache variable requires using a special form of the ``set`` function:

  .. signature:: |set|

     .. code-block:: cmake

        set(<variable> <value>... CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE])


Here is a list of few **CMake-defined variables**:

- ``PROJECT_BINARY_DIR``. This is the build folder for the project.
- ``PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR``. This is the location of the root ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the project.
- ``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR``. This is the folder for the ``CMakeLists.txt`` currently being processed.

Help on a specific built-in variable can be obtained with:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cmake --help-variable PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
